I am a MSc student at [Center for Data Science](https://www.ds.pku.edu.cn/), [Academy for Advanced lnterdisciplinary Studies](http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I received my B.E. degree from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2023.

My research interests broadly lie in domain-specific languages and compilers, large Scale Machine Learning, and accelerator architecture.  In particular, I focus on application-specific optimization on heterogeneous hardware, achieving significant performance acceleration in many applications.

Feel free to drop me an email if you have aligned interests.
